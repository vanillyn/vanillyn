im a **vanillyn**, its been about two years since my last project, im quite rusty

i write computer words, such as:
- js/html
- visual basic for office (aka c#)

i currently am only really doing small projects/forks, like:
- [vanillin](https://vanillyn.tk/vanillin)
- [webosu english](https://vanillyn.tk/webprojects/webosuen)
- [mc-rgbgen](https://vanillyn.tk/webprojects/rgbgen)

no i do not have money to pay for an actual domain and yes i know im getting ripped off
